# Osiris: a trading bot for the Penumbra shielded DEX ðŸ’¹

[Osiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx) is used for supplying liquidity to Penumbra testnets
by replicating market prices from the Binance public API. Osiris also serves as an example for how
a simple trading bot can be built against the Penumbra DEX.

This bot is the Alameda Research of Penumbra. It performs no risk management, portfolio rebalancing, or any other
best practices and only submits trades. Please use it only as a reference.

It does not duplicate command-line wallet management; rather, it shares a wallet by default with the
location of the wallet managed by the `pcli` command line Penumbra wallet. To set up Osiris, first
create a wallet with `pcli`, then send some tokens to that wallet on the test network. Then, you can
run Osiris:

## Obtaining dependencies

You must clone the [penumbra repo](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra)
side-by-side with the Osiris repo, so that the dependencies are available
as a relative path. This is a temporary workaround to support Git LFS
in the Penumbra dependencies.
See [GH29](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/galileo/issues/29) for details.

## Running it

```bash
RUST_LOG=osiris=info cargo run --release serve ETH BTC USD ATOM
```

This will monitor the [Binance websockets API](https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-trading-api/websocket_api) for
current market prices between all pairings of the assets provided on the CLI.

Based on current market prices, Osiris will use as much of its available liquidity as possible to provide positions
replicating Binance's market conditions within the Penumbra shielded DEX, using the positions' spread parameter to
represent the bid/ask spread from the market feed.

On first synchronization, the wallet must be caught up to speed with the state of the chain, which
can take some time; the `info`-level log output will inform you when the bot is ready.

A variety of options are available, including adjusting replication timing, and changing which node to
connect to (the default is the hosted Penumbra default testnet). Use the `--help` option for more details.

## Re-deploying after a testnet release
When we deploy a new testnet, we must bounce Osiris to keep the market-making working.
The steps are:

```
# Log into osiris host
ssh <your_first_name>@osiris.penumbra.zone
# Stop running service
sudo systemctl stop osiris

# Switch to unprivileged user
sudo su -l www-data -s /bin/bash

# Reset the client state for the new testnet
cd ~/penumbra
git fetch --tags
git checkout <latest_tag>
cargo run --release --bin pcli view reset

# Update osiris's source code
cd ~/osiris
git pull origin main
cargo update
cargo build --release

# Return to normal user
exit

# Edit the catch-up url arg
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/osiris.service
# Start Osiris again:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart osiris

# Confirm that Osiris is creating positions via pcli

# View logs for Osiris at any time with:
sudo journalctl -af -u osiris
```

These steps should be performed on release day, immediately after publishing the tag.
